This project is a web application focused on personnel management and tracking. It handles HTTP requests and interacts with data effectively. Employees are categorized by departments and specialties, and tasks can be assigned to them. The service automates processes such as tracking new hires, dismissals, transfers, and task assignment/removal via REST API.

Technologies used in the project include Spring Boot, Spring Validations, Spring Data JPA, Spring Web, Lombok, MySQL, and JSON. Spring Boot simplifies application development and setup. Spring Validations enable data validation. Spring Data JPA provides a convenient way to work with databases using Java Persistence API. Spring Web facilitates web application development and HTTP request handling. Lombok simplifies Java code development. MySQL is used as the relational database, and JSON is utilized for structured data exchange between the client and server.

The project is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for the addition of new components and functionality with minimal code changes. The architecture based on Spring Boot ensures flexibility and modularity, while Spring Data JPA and MySQL support scalability and advanced personnel tracking requirements.
